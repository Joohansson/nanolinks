Our latest release, V19.0 Solidus, is an excellent example of how helpful beta participants from the community have been, as they heavily tested builds for more than a month. Each of them enjoyed being on top of every recent development and optimization, often discussing data points at length and offering up contributions to our release.]]></description>

Community Awards are specific for the sub but they will not give the user any Reddit premium. However, the post gets a fancy Nano icon and 20% of the Award cost goes to the community chest. Those coins can be spent only by a moderator to give the "Nano Approved Hero" (the icon far to the right) to a user of our choice, which will bring 3 months of Reddit premium to that user!]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[The median has been 0.65-0.67 seconds for weeks according to repnode.org

Now the median from the past 24 hours is at 0.49! I'm waiting for the day-to-day graph to update. This with only 37% of the network nodes running on the latest protocol version and big reps like Brainblocks still on v18. I guess more nodes upgrading will have some kind of influence on the speed. Following the trend with excitement!]]></description>
