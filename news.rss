      <description><![CDATA[MoonPos is my attempt to help adoption of crypto by allowing merchants/restaurants/coffee shops/whatever other businesses to accept payments in cryptocurrencies in a simple, intuitive and safe way. We need more businesses to accept payments in cryptocurrencies.<br><br>MoonPos allows users to store public addresses and generate QR codes for payments. No private keys are stored, therefore the app is completely safe. MoonPos is not a wallet. A lot of you might agree that many crypto-related apps are not very pleasant to use, they feel like they have been made for engineers (by engineers). My app focuses on a pleasant and intuitive user experience. It is optimized for both smartphones and tablets. Cryptocurrency prices are refreshed often, so they are always up-to-date.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[My name is Trigger Haven. I'm a voiceover artist wizard from space who enjoys streaming video games and playing with crypto currencies. I've always found the streamer/viewer relationship to be somewhat wanting, and Nano is the perfect solution. I applied to The Nano Center because I believe Nano's instant and feeless nature has enormous potential in the streaming space through micro faucets, and, if funded, I'd like to demonstrate that through fun interactive games on my channel! My moderator/bot-maker, Ridsevilla, and I have been developing fun ways to use Nano (and its silly brother, Banano) to improve the streamer/viewer relationship for some time, and I'm excited to share what we've created with you.]]></description>
