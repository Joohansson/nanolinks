      <description><![CDATA[A wallet sweeper will search for any received or pending funds in any account/index bound to a master key, collect them and empty the wallet by transferring all funds to a new account. This can be useful in a variety of scenarios:<br><br>Your master key has been compromised and you wish to quickly move all funds, however complicated they are arranged, into a new fresh wallet account without exposing the new master key<br><br>Your Ledger hardware wallet is broken/stolen och you wish to recover the backup key with locked-up funds to a new fresh secure account (if not ordering a new device)<br><br>You were given a private key or seed as a gift or by a treasure hunt and wish to collect that into your existing wallet (that is not Natrium)<br><br>You simply have a lot of pending transactions you wish to collect (without transferring any funds)<br><br>Keytools Wallet Sweeper will solve this for you!]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Hi everyone, wanted to share something I've been working on for a bit on the side. I built a website called weacceptcryptocurrency.com which lists merchants online that accept crypto as payment.<br><br>I know there are already NANO-specific sites, but this will have a much wider reach as we begin to rank on Google for general crypto-related terms.<br><br>Another problem this site solves is I link whenever possible to the crypto payments page on the merchant site, because often there will be specific discounts or instructions for those looking to pay with cryptocurrency, which aren't easily found from the homepage.<br><br>I know the site looks shitty and is a beta-version, so please let me know how you think I could improve it.<br><br>Also let me know of merchants I'm missing that accept NANO as payment if you know of any. There is no fee for merchants to be listed on this site, nor will there ever be.<br><br>This website will always be free and free of ads for users. I believe in crypto long term which is why I'm committing time to this!]]></description>

Pippin is the first wallet of its kind that is 100% compatible with the developer wallet (aka “node wallet”) APIs. Of course the node wallet isn’t recommended for a lot of use cases, but a lot of developers use it anyway — because as you might expect, it’s the easiest solution and it generally works well enough. One of the goals of Pippin is to provide a production-ready, external key management solution that’s incredibly easy to setup and maintain.]]></description>
